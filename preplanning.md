** This page will be used to plan out all the interests I intend to talk about on this HTML project**
I'm still debating on whether or not I should build on this with every passing unit in code academy. (Once i learn CSS, add some of that, once i learn JavaScript, add some of that, and so on and so forth)

Homepage for website:

Introduction:
I went ahead and wrote an introduction paragraph discussing why I'm even starting a blog in the first place. That reason being that i just really need to practice my HTML and what better and  more motivating way to do that than to make a personal blog where i get to share and discuss my favorite hobbies.

Contact information:
I think that the contact information will expand to instagram (watch for the hate comments i'll be getting lol) and other social medias but for now i'll keep it professional and use my software engineering gmail account, github, and linkedin.

List of Interests:
After my introduction paragraphs i'd like to include an unorganized list of the hobbies i'm most interested in.

Explain why you want to rank your interests: Site Odysseas lol.

Table:
I want to create a table that will tier rank all my interests from most important to least important. I plan to do this by considering what makes the most sense to prioritze in my daily life at the moment. Whether that be because I don't have money or access to things that would allow me to explore those hobbies, I should take all of it into consideration when creating the table and ranking them.

* Will for sure be in classic S-F tier list format

Explanation for Rankings: 
Right at the bottom of the list I want to explain why certain things are ranked higher than others and site reasons Odysseas gave as to why prioritizing hobbies instead of trying to juggle them all is so important.

Spitballing ideas:
* Have some type of interactivity within the site:
- Have a header where each interest is it's own tag (think: home | shop | events | Info | Scheduling | ETC)

* Maybe a form where people can also tell you what their personal hobbies are (make sure its filters for dumb responses)

* Recommendation section for things pertaining to every interest you end up writing about:
- Reading (they can recommend books)
- Cars (they can recommend you their favorite models)
- ETC
