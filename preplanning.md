** This page will be used to plan out all the interests I intend to talk about on this HTML project**
I'm still debating on whether or not I should build on this with every passing unit in code academy. (Once i learn CSS, add some of that, once i learn JavaScript, add some of that, and so on and so forth)

Introduction:
I went ahead and wrote an introduction paragraph discussing why I'm even starting a blog in the first place. That reason being that i just really need to practice my HTML and what better and  more motivating way to do that than to make a personal blog where i get to share and discuss my favorite hobbies.

Contact information:
I think that the contact information will expand to instagram (watch for the hate comments i'll be getting lol) and other social medias but for now i'll keep it professional and use my software engineering gmail account, github, and linkedin.

List of Interests:
After my introduction paragraphs i'd like to include an unorganized list of the hobbies i'm most interested in.
