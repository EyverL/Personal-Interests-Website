        <h2>What You Can Find In My Personal Blog</h2>
        <article>
            <p id="introduction"> Absolutley no one asked me to make this blog, but I know<br>
            that I'll need a lot of practice using HTML to get any good at it.<br>
            What better way to get good at something like HTML than building<br>
            a website or personal blog discussing things you already find<br>
            interesting or do heavy research on!</p>
            <p id="interests">I sometimes think I have too many interests<br>
            and that I couldn't possibly juggle all of them at once. I<br>
            would be right! Some of my interests include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mixed Martial Arts</li>
                <li>Bodybuilding</li>
                <li>Cars</li>
                <li>Traveling</li>
                <li>Reading</li>
                <li>Fashion</li>
                <li>Music</li>
                <li>Movies</li>
            </ul>
            <aside>
                <p id="rambling"> I plan to use my passion for certain hobbies to build<br>
                a solid foundation and understanding in as many languages<br>
                as I can squeeze in here.</p>
